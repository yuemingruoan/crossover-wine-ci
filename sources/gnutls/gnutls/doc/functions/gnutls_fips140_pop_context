@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_fips140_pop_context} ( @var{void})

Dissociate the FIPS context currently
active on the current thread, reverting to the previously active
context. If a cryptographic operation is ongoing in the current
thread, e.g., @code{gnutls_aead_cipher_init()}  is called but
@code{gnutls_aead_cipher_deinit()}  is not yet called, it returns an error
@code{GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST} .

This function is no-op if FIPS140 is not compiled in nor enabled
at run-time.

@strong{Returns:} 0 upon success, a negative error code otherwise

@strong{Since:} 3.7.3
@end deftypefun
