@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_digest_set_secure} (gnutls_digest_algorithm_t @var{dig}, unsigned int @var{secure})
@var{dig}: is a digest algorithm

@var{secure}: whether to mark the digest algorithm secure

Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  @code{dig} as secure
or insecure. This only has effect when the algorithm is enabled
through the allowlisting mode in the configuration file, or when
the setting is modified with a prior call to this function.
