@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_ct_sct_get_version} (gnutls_x509_ct_scts_t @var{scts}, unsigned @var{idx}, unsigned int * @var{version_out})
@var{scts}: A list of SCTs

@var{idx}: The index of the target SCT in the list

@var{version_out}: The version of the target SCT.

This function obtains the version of the SCT at the given position
in the SCT list.

The version of that SCT will be placed on  @code{version_out} .

Return : @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned on success,
@code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE}  if  @code{idx} exceeds the number of SCTs in the list
and @code{GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST}  if the SCT's version is different than 1, as that's currently
the only defined version.
