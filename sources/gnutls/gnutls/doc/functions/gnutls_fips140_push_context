@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_fips140_push_context} (gnutls_fips140_context_t @var{context})
@var{context}: a @code{gnutls_fips140_context_t} 

Associate the FIPS  @code{context} to the current thread, diverting the
currently active context. If a cryptographic operation is ongoing
in the current thread, e.g., @code{gnutls_aead_cipher_init()}  is called
but @code{gnutls_aead_cipher_deinit()}  is not yet called, it returns an
error @code{GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST} .

The operation state of  @code{context} will be reset to
@code{GNUTLS_FIPS140_OP_INITIAL} .

This function is no-op if FIPS140 is not compiled in nor enabled
at run-time.

@strong{Returns:} 0 upon success, a negative error code otherwise

@strong{Since:} 3.7.3
