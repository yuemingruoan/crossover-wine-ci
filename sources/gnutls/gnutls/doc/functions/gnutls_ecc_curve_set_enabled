@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_ecc_curve_set_enabled} (gnutls_ecc_curve_t @var{curve}, unsigned int @var{enabled})
@var{curve}: is an ECC curve

@var{enabled}: whether to enable the curve

Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  @code{curve} as
enabled or disabled.  Calling this function is allowed
only if allowlisting mode is set in the configuration file,
and only if the system-wide TLS priority string
has not been initialized yet.
The intended usage is to provide applications with a way
to expressly deviate from the distribution or site defaults
inherited from the configuration file.
The modification is composable with further modifications
performed through the priority string mechanism.

This function is not thread-safe and is intended to be called
in the main thread at the beginning of the process execution.

@strong{Returns:} 0 on success or negative error code otherwise.

@strong{Since:} 3.7.3
