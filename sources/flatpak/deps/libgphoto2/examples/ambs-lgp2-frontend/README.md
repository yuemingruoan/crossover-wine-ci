automake buildsystem based example libgphoto2 frontend
====================================================

This is an example libgphoto2 frontend project using an automake base
build system.

Its main purpose is to allow libgphoto2 CI builds to test building a
libgphoto2 frontend against the built libgphoto2 without needing to
clone and build the complete gphoto2 command line interface frontend.

Additionally, it may serve as a bit of documentation by example.
