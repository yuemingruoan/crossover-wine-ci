# GStreamer: a flexible, fast and multiplatform multimedia framework

GStreamer is an extremely powerful and versatile framework for creating
streaming media applications. Many of the virtues of the GStreamer
framework come from its modularity: GStreamer can seamlessly incorporate
new plugin modules. But because modularity and power often come at a
cost of greater complexity, writing new applications is not always easy.
