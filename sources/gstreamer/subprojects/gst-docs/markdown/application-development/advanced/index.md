# Advanced GStreamer concepts

With the basics you learned in the previous part you should be able to create a
simple application, but GStreamer provides far more than just the mere basic for
multimedia playback. In this part we will cover more advanced GStreamer features
as well as some of its low-level internals.

Some chapters of this part serve mostly as an explanation of how GStreamer
internally works; like the ones covering scheduling, autoplugging and synchronization.
This knowledge is generally not required for actual application development.
Other chapters, however, discuss more advanced ways of pipeline-application
interaction that can be very useful for certain applications. These include the
chapters on metadata, querying and events, interfaces, dynamic parameters and
pipeline data manipulation.
